🚀 **Infrastructure Magician** | DevOps Specialist | SRE Extraordinaire  
*Automating all the things so you don’t have to!*

## 🛠️ What I Do
- **Infrastructure Management:** Herding servers so you don’t have to.
- **DevOps:** CI/CD pipelines so smooth, you’d think they butter themselves.
- **Site Reliability Engineering:** Keeping the lights on (and the pagers quiet).

---

## 💡 Top Skills
- **Automation:** If it can be scripted, I’ve probably already done it (maybe twice).
- **CI/CD:** Pushing code faster than my coffee kicks in.
- **Kubernetes:** Spinning up clusters like a cloud-native DJ.

*Automate building and pushing Docker images. It’s like magic, but with more YAML.*

## 🥒 Fun Fact
When I’m not automating your infrastructure, you’ll find me dominating the pickleball court or trying to break my Jeep on the trails.

<!---“Why do it manually when you can automate it and have time for pickleball?”
